# Quantum Explorer

This is a one-stop shop for basic and simple code snippets written using **Google's Cirq** quantum computer programming framework. It is my log diary of various operations that can be performed using Cirq and finding out if those operations can be performed on Quantum Computers. The list of code snippets will increase as I explore the Quantum world.
